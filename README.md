## ASPNETWebAPIReact
> This project includes a solution built with ASP.NET Core Web API and React. The end-to-end SPA (Secure Single-Page Application) consists of a simple React application which accesses the API and using create, read, update and delete operations to manipulate the data, which will be available to view via SQLite. This solution will help build my knowledge in this field and have hands-on experience with real world applications.
